TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS:

When using this shadcn template, follow these guidelines:

1. Component Selection:
   - Only import and use shadcn components that are actually needed for the project
   - Do not import all components at once
   - Use the shadcn CLI to add components as needed: npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]

2. CSS Configuration:
   - Ensure tailwind.config.js is properly configured
   - Keep the global.css file with proper shadcn imports
   - Do not modify the base shadcn styling system

3. Component Usage:
   - Import components directly from their respective directories
   - Follow shadcn's documentation for proper component usage
   - Maintain proper TypeScript types for all components

4. Styling:
   - Use Tailwind classes for custom styling
   - Extend the theme in tailwind.config.js when needed
   - Maintain consistent styling patterns

5. Performance:
   - Only import components that are actually used
   - Avoid unnecessary component imports
   - Keep bundle size optimized

Remember: This template is optimized for shadcn/ui components. Use them appropriately and only when needed.
